# Understanding the Main Method in Java: Building a Command-Line Tool

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental structure and purpose of Java's main method
- Learn how to handle command-line arguments in Java programs
- Develop practical skills in building command-line utilities
- Progress from basic to advanced command-line programming concepts

#### Introduction

The main method in Java is like the front door to your program – it's where everything begins. When you run a Java
program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks specifically for this method to know where to start execution.
Understanding the main method is crucial because it serves as the bridge between your operating system and your Java
program, enabling command-line interaction and program execution.

The main method plays a pivotal role in the Java ecosystem because it represents the entry point that connects the
operating system to your application. Unlike some other programming languages where you can write code that executes
immediately, Java enforces structure by requiring all executable code to be contained within methods, and the main
method serves as the designated starting point. This design philosophy aligns with Java's object-oriented nature and
helps maintain consistency across different Java applications.

#### Basic Structure of a Java Program

Let's look at the simplest possible Java program:

```java
package academy.javapro;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Think of this code as the blueprint for your program. Let's break it down piece by piece:

- The `public class HelloWorld` part is like creating a container for your program. In Java, everything needs to be
  inside a class, and the name of this class (HelloWorld) must match your file name (HelloWorld.java).

- The `public static void main(String[] args)` line is packed with important information:
    - `public` means any other part of your program can access this method
    - `static` means you don't need to create an object to use this method
    - `void` tells Java that this method won't return any value
    - `main` is the special name Java looks for to start your program
    - `String[] args` is an array that holds any command-line arguments passed to your program

Inside the method, `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` is your program's way of communicating with the user – it
prints text to the console.

Each keyword in the main method signature serves a specific purpose in Java's ecosystem. The `public` access modifier
ensures that the JVM can access this method from outside the class. The `static` keyword means the method belongs to the
class itself rather than to instances of the class, allowing the JVM to call it without creating an object first.
The `void` return type indicates that the main method doesn't return any value when it completes execution, which makes
sense for an entry point method. The `String[] args` parameter is especially important as it creates a bridge between
the operating system's command line and your Java program, enabling users to influence program behavior without
modifying the code.

#### Compiling and Running a Java Program

To run this program, you need two commands:

```
javac academy/javapro/HelloWorld.java
java academy.javapro.HelloWorld
```

The first command (javac) compiles your code, turning it from human-readable text into bytecode that Java can execute.
The second command (java) actually runs your program.

The compilation process is a fundamental aspect of Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. When you run `javac`,
the compiler translates your high-level Java code into an intermediate bytecode format (.class files) that is
platform-independent. This bytecode isn't directly executable by your computer's processor but instead is designed to be
interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine. The `java` command launches the JVM, which reads your compiled bytecode and
executes it on the fly, translating the bytecode instructions into native machine code specific to your operating system
and hardware. This two-step process creates a layer of abstraction that enables true cross-platform compatibility while
maintaining performance through techniques like Just-In-Time compilation.

#### Working with Command-Line Arguments

Now that we understand the basics, let's make our program more interactive by working with command-line arguments.
Command-line arguments are like messages we can send to our program when we start it:

```java
package academy.javapro;

public class Greeter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length > 0) {
            System.out.println("Hello, " + args[0] + "!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Hello, stranger!");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Understanding Command-Line Arguments

This program introduces several important concepts that build upon our basic understanding. Let's examine how it works:

The `if (args.length > 0)` line checks if any arguments were provided when the program was run. Think of args.length as
counting how many messages were passed to your program. If someone runs the program with their name as an argument,
args.length will be 1, and args[0] will contain their name.

Command-line arguments provide a powerful mechanism for customizing program behavior without changing the source code.
They represent a form of program input that occurs at the moment of execution rather than during runtime. This approach
to parameterization is particularly valuable for utility programs, scripts, and server applications where different
configurations might be needed in different environments. The `args` array is simply a standard Java array of strings,
with each element representing a space-separated value from the command line. Understanding how to properly parse and
validate these arguments is essential for building robust command-line tools that can handle various input scenarios
gracefully.

When you run this program, you have two options:

```text
# First, compile the file
javac src/main/java/academy/javapro/Greeter.java

# Then run it (assuming you're in the project root directory)
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.Greeter Alice

# To run without arguments
# Using the -cp (classpath) option to tell Java where to find your compiled classes
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.Greeter
```

In the first case, "Alice" becomes args[0], and your program uses it in the greeting. In the second case, since no
arguments are provided, `args.length` is 0, and your program falls back to the default "stranger" greeting.

The `-cp` (or `-classpath`) option is a crucial aspect of Java's class loading mechanism. It tells the JVM where to look
for user-defined classes, effectively creating a search path for compiled class files. This becomes increasingly
important as your projects grow more complex with multiple packages and dependencies. In production environments, the
classpath often includes JAR files (Java Archives), external libraries, and framework components. Understanding how to
properly configure the classpath is essential for resolving common "ClassNotFoundException" errors and ensuring that
your application can locate all the resources it needs to run correctly.

#### Advanced Argument Processing

Let's take our understanding further with a more practical example – a simple calculator that works with command-line
arguments:

```java
package academy.javapro;

public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 2) {
            System.out.println("Usage: java Calculator <number1> <number2>");
            return;
        }

        try {
            int num1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
            int num2 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);

            System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
            System.out.println("Product: " + (num1 * num2));
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Please provide valid numbers");
        }
    }
}
```

We can run this program with two numbers as arguments:

```text
javac src/main/java/academy/javapro/Calculator.java
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.Calculator 10 20
```

#### Error Handling and Input Validation

This calculator program demonstrates several advanced concepts in a practical way. Let's break it down:

First, we check if exactly two arguments were provided using `if (args.length != 2)`. This is important because our
calculator needs exactly two numbers to work. If we don't get exactly two arguments, we print usage instructions and
exit using `return`.

The try-catch block is like a safety net. Inside the try block, we attempt to convert the string arguments to integers
using `Integer.parseInt()`. This method takes a string (like "123") and turns it into a number (123). However, if
someone provides invalid input (like "abc"), parseInt will throw a NumberFormatException, which our catch block handles
gracefully by displaying an error message.

After successful conversion, we perform two operations (addition and multiplication) and display the results. This shows
how we can process and manipulate command-line arguments to create useful tools.

Robust error handling is a hallmark of professional-quality software. The try-catch mechanism in Java provides
structured exception handling that allows your program to respond gracefully to unexpected conditions without crashing.
When working with user input, particularly from command-line arguments, validation becomes critical since you cannot
control what values users might provide. The approach demonstrated here follows the "fail fast" principle, where
potential issues are identified as early as possible in the program flow. This not only improves user experience by
providing clear error messages but also protects the program from attempting operations with invalid data that could
lead to more serious errors downstream.

#### Basic File System Operations

Let's move on to something more practical – a program that lists the contents of a directory. This introduces file
system operations, a common task in real-world applications:

```java
package academy.javapro;

import java.io.File;

public class SimpleLs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the target directory
        String path = ".";  // Default to current directory

        // If a path is provided, use it instead
        if (args.length > 0) {
            path = args[0];
        }

        // Create a File object for the directory
        File directory = new File(path);

        // Check if the directory exists and is actually a directory
        if (!directory.exists() || !directory.isDirectory()) {
            System.out.println("Error: Not a valid directory");
            return;
        }

        // Get the list of files and directories
        String[] contents = directory.list();

        // Check if we can list the contents
        if (contents != null) {
            // Print each item
            for (String item : contents) {
                System.out.println(item);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Working with Files and Directories

This file listing program introduces several important concepts for working with files and directories. Let's examine
how it works:

The program starts with a default path "." which represents the current directory. This is a common practice in
command-line tools – provide a sensible default but allow users to specify their own path.

We create a File object using the path. This object provides methods for working with files and directories in Java.
The `exists()` method checks if the path points to something real, while `isDirectory()` confirms it's actually a
directory and not a file.

The `directory.list()` method returns an array of strings containing the names of all files and directories in the
specified path. We check if this array is null (which could happen if we don't have permission to read the directory)
before trying to use it.

Finally, we use a for-each loop to print each item in the directory. This demonstrates how to iterate over an array in
Java, a fundamental programming concept.

File system operations represent an interface between your Java program and the underlying operating system.
Java's `java.io.File` class provides a platform-independent way to interact with the file system, abstracting away
differences between Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems. This abstraction is powerful but comes with
certain limitations – particularly around file permissions and metadata – which is why Java later introduced the more
comprehensive `java.nio.file` package in Java 7. The defensive programming approach shown here, with explicit checks for
existence and type, helps create robust applications that can handle real-world file system scenarios like missing
files, permission issues, or unexpected file types.

#### Running the Directory Listing Program

When you run this program, you have two options:

```text
javac src/main/java/academy/javapro/SimpleLs.java

# default to current directory
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.SimpleLs .

# Run the program with a specific directory
 java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.SimpleLs ../info-session
```

When executing Java programs with file system operations, it's important to understand how paths are resolved relative
to the working directory. The working directory is the directory from which you run the Java command, not necessarily
the directory where your class files are located. This can sometimes lead to confusion when files aren't found where
expected. Absolute paths (starting with / on Unix-like systems or a drive letter on Windows) provide certainty at the
cost of portability, while relative paths offer flexibility but require more careful handling. Good command-line tools
usually support both approaches and provide clear feedback when paths cannot be resolved correctly.

#### Advanced Implementation: A Comprehensive File Listing Tool

Now let's look at a more sophisticated version that mirrors the functionality of the Unix ls command:

```java
package academy.javapro;

import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.*;

public class AdvancedLs {
    // Configuration flags
    private final boolean showHidden = false;
    private final boolean longFormat = false;
    private final boolean sortByTime = false;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance and run the program
        new AdvancedLs().run(args);
    }

    public void run(String[] args) {
        String targetPath = ".";
        List<String> options = new ArrayList<>();

        // Process command line arguments
        for (String arg : args) {
            if (arg.startsWith("-")) {
                // This is an option flag
                processOption(arg.substring(1));
            } else {
                // This is a path
                targetPath = arg;
            }
        }

        // List the directory contents
        listDirectory(targetPath);
    }

    private void processOption(String options) {
        // Process each character in the option string
        for (char option : options.toCharArray()) {
            switch (option) {
                case 'a':
                    showHidden = true;
                    break;
                case 'l':
                    longFormat = true;
                    break;
                case 't':
                    sortByTime = true;
                    break;
                case 'h':
                    printHelp();
                    System.exit(0);
                default:
                    System.err.println("Unknown option: " + option);
                    printHelp();
                    System.exit(1);
            }
        }
    }

    private void listDirectory(String path) {
        try {
            File directory = new File(path);
            File[] files = directory.listFiles();

            if (files == null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to list directory contents");
            }

            // Filter and sort files
            List<File> fileList = new ArrayList<>();
            for (File file : files) {
                if (showHidden || !file.getName().startsWith(".")) {
                    fileList.add(file);
                }
            }

            // Sort the files
            if (sortByTime) {
                fileList.sort((f1, f2) -> Long.compare(f2.lastModified(), f1.lastModified()));
            } else {
                fileList.sort((f1, f2) -> f1.getName().compareToIgnoreCase(f2.getName()));
            }

            // Display the files
            for (File file : fileList) {
                if (longFormat) {
                    displayDetailedInfo(file);
                } else {
                    System.out.println(file.getName());
                }
            }

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private void displayDetailedInfo(File file) {
        try {
            Path path = file.toPath();
            BasicFileAttributes attrs = Files.readAttributes(path, BasicFileAttributes.class);

            // Format the file information
            String type = Files.isDirectory(path) ? "d" : "-";
            String permissions = getBasicPermissions(file);
            String size = String.format("%8d", file.length());
            String modifiedDate = new SimpleDateFormat("MMM dd HH:mm")
                    .format(new Date(file.lastModified()));

            System.out.printf("%s%s %s %s %s%n",
                    type, permissions, size, modifiedDate, file.getName());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error getting file details: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private String getBasicPermissions(File file) {
        
        /* This method creates a simplified representation of Unix-style file permissions.
         * In Unix systems, files have separate permission sets for three categories of users:
         * the owner of the file, the group associated with the file, and all other users.
         * For simplicity, this implementation generates just one set of permissions based on
         * the current Java process's access rights, then repeats that same pattern three times
         * rather than calculating the actual separate permissions for each user category as a
         * full implementation would.
         */
        StringBuilder perms = new StringBuilder();
        perms.append(file.canRead() ? "r" : "-");
        perms.append(file.canWrite() ? "w" : "-");
        perms.append(file.canExecute() ? "x" : "-");
        // Repeat for user, group, others (simplified)
        // repeat(3) means repeat the string 3 times
        return perms.toString().repeat(3);
    }

    private void printHelp() {
        System.out.println("Usage: java AdvancedLs [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]");
        System.out.println("Options:");
        System.out.println("  -a    Show hidden files");
        System.out.println("  -l    Use long listing format");
        System.out.println("  -t    Sort by modification time");
        System.out.println("  -h    Display this help message");
    }
}
```

#### Object-Oriented Program Structure

This advanced implementation builds upon everything we've learned and adds several new concepts. Let's break it down
section by section:

The program is organized as a proper Java class with instance variables (`showHidden`, `longFormat`, `sortByTime`).
These variables control the program's behavior and can be modified by command-line options. This is an example of
encapsulation, a key principle of object-oriented programming.

The transition from procedural to object-oriented design represents a significant evolution in programming approach. In
our earlier examples, we used static methods within a class primarily as a container for code. Now, we're leveraging
true object-oriented principles where the class becomes a blueprint for creating objects with state (instance variables)
and behavior (methods). This approach provides several advantages: it improves code organization by grouping related
functionality, enables better abstraction by hiding implementation details, facilitates code reuse through inheritance
and composition, and makes the program more maintainable as it grows in complexity. The use of instance variables to
track program configuration demonstrates the concept of object state, where an object can "remember" information
throughout its lifetime.

#### Main Method and Program Flow

The main method is now very simple – it creates an instance of the class and delegates the actual work to the run
method. This is a common pattern in larger programs as it allows us to use instance variables and methods more easily.

This refactoring of the main method demonstrates an important design pattern often seen in professional Java
applications. By delegating the actual program logic to instance methods, we overcome the limitations of static methods
and gain access to the full power of object-oriented programming. This pattern, sometimes called the "static main method
pattern," serves as a bridge between the static entry point required by the JVM and the instance-based world of
object-oriented design. It's particularly useful in larger applications where you might want to create multiple
instances with different configurations, implement inheritance hierarchies, or utilize dependency injection frameworks.
The separation of concerns between program initialization (in main) and program logic (in instance methods) improves
testability as well, since instance methods can be more easily tested in isolation.

#### Command-Line Option Processing

The `processOption` method handles command-line flags like `-a` and `-l`. It uses a switch statement to process each
option character, updating the appropriate instance variables. This shows how to create a flexible command-line
interface that accepts multiple options.

Command-line option processing is a common requirement in many utility programs, and our implementation demonstrates a
simplified version of how tools like Git, Docker, or npm handle their command-line interfaces. The approach used here –
parsing options that begin with a dash and treating other arguments as file or directory paths – follows Unix
convention. For more complex command-line interfaces, developers often turn to specialized libraries like Apache Commons
CLI, JCommander, or Picocli, which provide robust option parsing, automatic help generation, and support for both
short (-a) and long (--all) option formats. Our switch statement implementation offers flexibility for simple tools
while demonstrating fundamental string processing techniques applicable to many text-processing scenarios.

#### File Listing and Sorting

The `listDirectory` method demonstrates several advanced concepts:

- Creating an ArrayList to store File objects
- Filtering files based on user preferences (showing/hiding hidden files)
- Sorting files either alphabetically or by modification time using lambda expressions
- Using try-catch blocks for robust error handling

Collections form the backbone of data manipulation in Java, and our transition from arrays to ArrayList demonstrates an
important evolution in how we work with groups of objects. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size determined at
creation, ArrayList is a dynamic data structure that can grow or shrink as needed. This flexibility comes at a small
performance cost but greatly simplifies code that needs to add or remove elements. The sorting operations showcase
Java's functional programming capabilities through lambda expressions, introduced in Java 8. These compact function
definitions allow us to specify custom sorting behavior with minimal syntax, making the code more readable and
maintainable. Modern Java applications commonly combine collections with functional programming features like streams,
lambdas, and method references to create expressive, efficient data processing pipelines.

#### Detailed File Information

The `displayDetailedInfo` method shows how to:

- Work with file attributes using the nio.file package
- Format output using String.format
- Handle file permissions
- Display file sizes and modification times

The NIO (New I/O) packages introduced in Java 7 represent a significant advancement over the original java.io APIs.
While our program uses both APIs for educational purposes, in production code, developers often prefer the nio packages
for their improved performance, more comprehensive feature set, and better abstractions. The Files class provides static
utility methods that offer a more functional approach to file operations, while the Path interface offers a more
flexible and powerful alternative to the File class. The BasicFileAttributes interface demonstrates how NIO facilitates
access to file metadata in a platform-independent way, addressing limitations in the original File class. The use of
String.format and printf-style formatting shows how to create well-aligned, readable console output – an important
consideration for command-line tools where clear presentation of information is essential.

#### Help System

The `printHelp` method provides clear usage instructions, which is a crucial feature of any command-line tool.

Documentation is often an afterthought in software development, but professional developers recognize that good help
systems are a critical component of usable software. The printHelp method demonstrates several best practices: it
describes the program's purpose, explains each option with a consistent format, shows the command syntax with
placeholders for variable parts, and uses spacing to improve readability. For command-line tools, this type of built-in
documentation is particularly important since users may not have easy access to external reference materials while
working in a terminal. The convention of using -h or --help to display usage information is widely adopted across
platforms and helps users discover how to use your program even if they've never encountered it before.

#### Running the Advanced Directory Listing Program

To run the AdvancedLs program from the terminal, you can use various command-line options to customize the file listing
based on your preferences. The program is designed to list the contents of a directory, with several options to control
the output format and the way files are sorted.

List files in the current directory:

```
javac src/main/java/academy/javapro/AdvancedLs.java
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.AdvancedLs
```

Show hidden files:

```
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.AdvancedLs -a
```

List files with detailed information (long format):

```
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.AdvancedLs -l
```

List files in a specific directory:

```
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.AdvancedLs -l /etc
```

Use multiple options:

```
java -cp src/main/java academy.javapro.AdvancedLs -a -l -t /opt/homebrew
```

The combination of options and arguments demonstrates the flexibility of command-line interfaces for utilities like our
file listing tool. By following established conventions from Unix-like systems, our program becomes intuitive for users
familiar with those environments. The ability to combine multiple options (like -a -l -t) improves usability by allowing
customized behavior without requiring separate commands. This approach to parameterization through command-line
arguments exemplifies the "configuration over coding" principle, where behavior can be adjusted without modifying source
code. As you develop more sophisticated command-line tools, consider implementing additional features like recursive
directory traversal (-R), human-readable file sizes (-h), or custom output formatting options to further enhance
functionality.

### Summary

Through this lesson, we've covered a wide range of Java programming concepts:

- The structure and purpose of the main method
- Working with command-line arguments
- File system operations
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Error handling
- User interface design

Remember: Good command-line tools should be focused, reliable, and user-friendly. Start with the basics and gradually
add features while maintaining code quality and user experience.

The progression from a simple "Hello, World!" program to a sophisticated file listing utility mirrors the learning
journey of many Java developers. By building upon foundational concepts incrementally, we've created a practical
application that demonstrates real-world programming techniques. The command-line interface, while less flashy than
graphical alternatives, remains an essential tool in a developer's arsenal, particularly for system administration,
automation, and developer tooling. The skills developed through this exercise – parsing input, handling errors, working
with files, and organizing code – transfer directly to more complex applications, including web services, desktop
applications, and enterprise systems. As you continue your Java journey, remember that mastering these fundamentals
provides the scaffold upon which more advanced concepts like multithreading, networking, frameworks, and design patterns
can be built.
